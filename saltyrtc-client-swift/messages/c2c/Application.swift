/**
 Application message.

 This class is still under construction
 
 This message type SHOULD actually take arbitrary data, but that's currently not what it does.
 Currently you may only give Swift-Foundation objects (e.g. Dictionarys). These will be encoded to json and then encoded to psgpack. This means you will get a msgpack dictionary, with the keys "type" and "data". The value for "type" will be "application", but "data" will contain a further dictionary of keys and values of value encoded in JSON(!).
